### lknknm neovim setup

The overall idea of this setup is not to transform neovim into a full-fledged IDE, but to provide enough modularity and concision 
in order to use it along other tools as I personally might see fit. This is why mostly for now it is quite of a minimal setup enough
to get things done and to provide me some easy access to grep, LSP and linting tools.

For my personal workflow, I have ditched IDEs and am favouring flexible setups with the possibility of porting it to different systems
instead of relying to IDE tools that sometimes are unavailable from one system to the other or too cumbersome to port
(for example having to bounce between Jetbrains Rider and CLion between my arch Linux and MacOS setup like I used to do). Using neovim has been amazing in that
regard because I can have some uniformity across basically any platform, and if something breaks I might know more easily where it breaks.

This is also one of the reasons I didn't want to "revolutionise" neovim and transform it into an IDE. This way I can easily choose 
compiler I want to use and when (usually Clang or GCC), fireup the LLDB debugger + use it fully as CLI tool, and even which terminal emulator I might opt for.
Favouring the terminal and CLI tools has been an impressive speed boost for me and really good for keeping the flow between different stages of development.
